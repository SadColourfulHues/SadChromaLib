# SadChromaLib
The super-module of SadChromaLib. It implements a variety of commonly-used features in game development. Its design is based partially from my 'Lumbra' library, but adapted to Godot 4.1.

Modules:

SadChromaLib.AI:
  -> A module implementing AI components for in-game entities. It also features base classes for project-specific behaviour nodes and/or state machines.

SadChromaLib.Animation:
  -> A module implementing procedural methods for animating in-game objects.

SadChromaLib.Utils:
  -> A module implementing core types and helper classes for many SadChromaLib submodules.

SadChromaLib.Tests:
  -> A module implementing instances for testing SadChromaLib functionality.
